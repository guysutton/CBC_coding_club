# CBC coding club

Welcome to the CBC Coding Club site. 

I will store all the data, code and information for our R sessions here. Please see the folders above for the data and scripts for each individual session. I will also add important information to these folders prior to the sessions, so that you know what will be covered in each session, what I require from you beforehand and any requests from you. 

Sessions are open to anyone who is keen to learn how to use R and/or develop their existing R skills,
irrespective of your experience levels. New users, beginners, experts, please all feel free. I am by no means
an expert, so if anyone has cool R code and would be happy to contribute, please chat to me. I am super
keen to learn.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions,
ect, please contact me (Guy) at g.sutton@ru.ac.za
